# DOCKERS
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers package an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight unit, ensuring consistency across various environments. Docker uses images—read-only templates—to create these containers, which are isolated but share the host OS kernel. With tools like Docker Compose, users can define and manage multi-container applications easily. Docker Hub serves as a registry for sharing and storing images. Overall, Docker enhances portability, efficiency, and scalability, streamlining the application development lifecycle.
